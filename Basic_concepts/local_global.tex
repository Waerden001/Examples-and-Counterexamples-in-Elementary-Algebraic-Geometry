\begin{example}[Hartshorne, Example $\mathrm{III}.10.0.2$]
If $X$ is integral Noetherian then $$\dim_{k(x)}\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x)=n$$
is equivalent to $\Omega_{X/Y}$ being locally free of rank $n$. Hartshorne's book has a standard proof, here's a silly remark, if in some case $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is a flat sheaf on $X$, then we can apply the cohomology and base change theorem to the identity morphism $\mathrm{id}:X\rightarrow X$, then the theorem says (in this special situation) exactly the equivalence of these two condition.
